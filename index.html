    <section id="Misinformation-vs-Disinformation">

        <h2 id="1">Misinformation vs Disinformation</h2>

        <p>Misinformation is just spreading false information, 
            meaning the person spreading them may, or may not
            not they are false.
        </p>
           <p>  Disinformation on the other hand
            strictly means that the person or group spreading
             these false information know they are false.
             Their purposes differ. Maybe for personal gain,
            like attracting attention to their site, or
        sum financial deal with another group, ideological
        promotion by harming the other ideologies' reputation.
        Maybe for their definition of fun or bragging about
being able to manipulate people.

<section id="Consequences">

    <h2 id="2">Consequences of false information</h2>
    <p>The Consequences of false information are
numerous, can vary according to their type, and can have
huge negative impact.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public incitement :</strong>Misleading
news against a certain group of people based on their
religion, race, or idealogy can cause division and 
tension in society, leading to hatred, violence
and crimes and the rise of radical groups.</p>
</li>





<li><p><strong >Endangering public or individual health:
</strong>
False information about diseases, medical treatment
 , or procedures can cause distrust and reject 
 scientific evidence and guidance. This can mislead 
 people into harming themselves and not seeking medical
 advice when needed.</p> 
</li>






<li><p><strong>Destroying a person identity:</strong>
 Misinforming may also target an individual, shaming
 them and ruining their relationships. Destroying
 someone's character has a devastating impact on the 
 person and may lead them to hurt themselves or
 others. Maybe this effect needs its own covering
 since it isn't talked a lot about, and the growth of social media makes hurting someone's emotions
 very easy.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<section>
<h2 id="3">Techniques of misinformation</h2>

<p>Misinformation has different techniques and you
    may have encountered them before. Here are some:
</p>


<ul>

<li> <p> <strong>
Emotional manipulation:</strong>
That have different types, using sensational
 headlines or images, using subjective personal
 stories and emotive tones for persuasion and making
 advantage of people in a vulnerable state.</p><p>An 
    example of the latter is taking advantage of people
with anxiety disorders. Putting a misleading headline
like "Panic attacks can harm you". A title like that
scares someone with anxiety. They open the site hoping
they find something comforting despite the headline,
but the misleader's plan is to scare them more, so 
they continue browsing and like that the misleader
have managed to gain views for this site, despite
the scientific evidence and medical professional
experts saying the opposite.     

</p>

   

</li>

<li><p>
<strong>Deception:</strong> Deception involves
distorting and manipulating the shape of data to
push a narrative or a claim. Some examples are 
using different scales for data, not highlighting
the difference between causality and correlation,
small or biased data sampling and using a reference
for known figures with quotes they never said.</p>





</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Rumors:</strong>A rumor is a story or
     a statement that got circulated around 
   people without evidence. Rumors can be created
   around events disguising the truth.
   sometimes they can even be created from zero.
   Creating or helping to spread them is a form of
   misinformation.  </p></li>
    
    


</ul>




</section>




<section>

<h2 id="4">Prevention and correction of misinformation</h2>
<p>I think it's fair to say this is all
responsibility. It can hurt any of us or someone
we know, so let's talk about ways to avoid falling
for them.    
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Recognize the purpose and source of the
 information:</strong>You have to always
think about the purpose of the information you read
and its source. Inspect the credibility of whoever
is telling them. It's a good attribute to be somewhat
skeptical of what you read and not fall for lies
or unsupported claims.</p>


</li>





<li>



<p><strong>Understand the techniques and
effects of the information: </strong>
It's a good measure to sometimes read about
the techniques and effects of false information
like this article. Of course, you can find more
info about the subject throughout the internet
  or books if you are interested.

</p>
</li>


<li><p>
<strong>Recognizing our responsibility
    when sharing and creating information:</strong>
 With the massive growth of social media and
 the internet, the flow and size of information 
 have followed up. Anyone can share their stories or
 give info about a subject they know about. Always 
 beware if someone is spreading false information 
 or talking about events that never happen,
intentionally or not. Don't be a part of unsupported
claims that might hurt someone or a group of people.</p>
